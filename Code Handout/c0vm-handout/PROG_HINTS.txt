For case RETURN:
You will write code here to implement a return operation. Later, when
you implement INVOKESTATIC, you will need to revise RETURN to handle
all steps below since you may be returning from an arbitrary function,
not necessarily main.

Basic steps:
1. Pop return value off the operand stack.
2. Free the current local variables array and operand stack.
3. If callStack is empty, return that value as an int.
4. Pop a frame off the callstack.
5. Restore V, S, P, and pc from the stack frame.
6. Free the stack frame.
7. Push the return value onto the operand stack.


For case INVOKESTATIC:
You will write code to implement an invokestatic operation (i.e. call a
user-supplied function).  Remember to go back to RETURN and revise it since
it may return from this function call now (rather than returning from the
main function).

Basic steps:
Let fi denote the struct function_info for the called function.
1. Build a stack frame containing current code pointer,
   current pc, current locals, and current operand stack.
   Push this stack frame onto the call stack.
2. Allocate a new locals array of size fi.num_vars.
3. Pop fi.num_args values off the stack and put them into
   the new locals array.
4. Create a new, empty operand stack.
5. Load the new code into the program array.
6. Set the program counter to 0.


For case INVOKENATIVE:
You will need to call the function with an array of argument values and
store the returned result on the operand stack.
